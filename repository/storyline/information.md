#Cutscene labelling information
###IF antagonist cutscene, label "antagonist-cutscene(number in chronological order)".
###IF optional antagonist cutscene, label "optional-cutscene-a(number in chronological order)". 
"a" stands for antagonist.
###IF protagonist cutscene, label "protagonist-cutscene(number in chronological order)".
###IF optional protagonist cutscene, label "optional-cutscene-p(number in chronological order)".
"p" stands for protagonist.
##Players can follow the antagonist/protagonist quest path (and cutscenes), but still be able to take the other type of quest until their relation points get too low. 
For example, at "antagonist-quest.1.5", the player will be prompted more to follow the antagonist quest path, but can still take protagonist quests. However, the antagonist quests would undermind the protagonist quests and could greatly decrease their relation points, up until the point where the guards kill / apprehend on site. Past (placeholder number) -30 relation points, the player cannot take protagonist quests for that city. If the player receives -30 RPs (relation points) for more than 3 major cities or 5 towns / villages / minor cities, they will not be able to take protagonist quests for that continent.
###Taking protagonist quest paths will increase the relation points between the player and the city that they are in. If the player lets their RPs drop to -20 (placeholder number), they will receive a "warning" letter from that place's mayor (or next high-standing character, if the mayor is dead) prompting them to up their behaviour. Warnings like this can also be sent by other characters.
