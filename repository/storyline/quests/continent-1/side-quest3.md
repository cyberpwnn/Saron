#Meet-Greet Quest
The player will pass through the wreckages of a house near the cave and see a charater. The character will run up to them and ask, "Excuse me, do you have a second?". If the player interacts with the character, the following will happen.

```
Victim: Excuse me, do you have a second?
Player [O]: Sure. (1) / No, I'm busy. (2)
  Victim (2): Oh okay, I'll find someone else. {End interaction.}
Victim: Somebody set my house alight and now I have nowhere to stay. Please, will you deliver this note to my friend? She lives on the city borders, west of here. 
Player [O]: Of course! (1) / Find someone else. (2)
  Victim (2): Alright... {Give minus relation points and end interaction.}
Victim: Thank you! Let me know what she says! {End interaction.}
```
