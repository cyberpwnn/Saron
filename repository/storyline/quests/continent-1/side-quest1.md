#Fetch Quest
As the player passes a tavern near the Mayor's office on the way to the cave they will hear a shout of "You there! Over here!".
If the player chooses to interact with the character, the following will occur.

Drunk: <slurring> Yes, you. Come 'ere. <walking over to player a little, not in a straight line, slowly> Do me a favour, would you?
Player [O]: What is it? (1) / No, I don't have time for you. (2)
  Drunk (2): Wow... <grumbling> you're a... you're a... pesky one eh? Leave me be... {give minus relation points and end interaction}
Drunk (1): Get me a refill of this would you? In that.. there, over there <pointing to tavern>.. Make sure it's strong...
