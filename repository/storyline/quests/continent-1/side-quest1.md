#Fetch Quest
As the player passes a tavern near the Mayor's office on the way to the cave they will hear a shout of "You there! Over here!".
If the player chooses to interact with the character, the following will occur.

##Dialogue
```
Drunk: You there! Over here!
Player: Me?
Drunk: <slurring> Yes, you. Come 'ere. <walking over to player a little, not in a straight line, slowly> Do me a favour, would you?
Player [O]: What is it? (1) / No, I don't have time for you. (2)

```
