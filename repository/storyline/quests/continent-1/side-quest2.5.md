##Dialogue
```
Merchant: Hey! You look a little empty handed there. Are you on a quest?
Player [O] : Yes, that's right. (1) / No, I'm just wondering around. (2) / Nothing to do with you. What do you want? 
  Merchent (3): Wow, okay then.. Don't worry, I'll give it to someone else. {Give minus relation points and end interaction.}
Merchant: Ah, I see. You should take a look around here, I think we might have something you could use.. Follow me!
Merchant: <stopping at a weaponsmith stall> Here, take your pick. On the house! {Open GUI with wooden swords with unbreaking II, sharpness II, fire aspect I or knockback II, or a stone sword with unbreaking I.}
Merchant: No hurry!
Merchant: <after player has selected> I hope you find it useful! Feel free to take a look around, we have other things too.
