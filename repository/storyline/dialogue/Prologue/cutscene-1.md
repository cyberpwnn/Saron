Cutscene 1

Player: <enters courtroom and bows to King's general> You wanted to see me?
General: Rise, squire. You have been summoned on account of the recent events North of this continent. Be seated at the table.
Player: <sits at a large table with the general, jester and advisor> I have heard of their issues, what-
Jester: Snow down! <laughs at their own joke> 
Advisor: This is serious, Jester! I will not have you interrupt my meeting.
General: <looking at advisor> My meeting. <looking at player> The recent and consistent blizzards in the North and the rise in the hostility of creatures poses a concerning threat to our great continent.  
Player: <nodding, drawing small diagram on paper> Could the blizzards be a cause of the creatures' hostility? A super-natural force, as it were?
Advisor: If you ask me-
General: We didn't. Don't interrupt-
Advisor: But the jester-!
General: <quietly> I said. Don't. Interrupt.
Jester: Yeah! Be ice! <laughs>
Advisor: <stands up angrily> Does he have to be here? He's constantly interrupting!
Jester: I-
General: <angrily> Shut up! <looks at player> Squire, I want you to investigate the source of the disturbing behaviour before it reaches us. A boat will be waiting for you by the dock. Go now.
Player: <nods> Yes, General.
