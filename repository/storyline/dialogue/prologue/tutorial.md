[O] -> Optional responses.

Tour Guide [TG]: <after player interacts with them> Hello, squire! I have been expecting you. Are you here on a mission for the General?
Player [O]: Yes, that's right. (1) / No, goodbye! (2)
    TG: (2) Have a great day!
TG: (1) Alright. Follow me. <walking player on to the boat, stopping in the centre. The boat gains speed as it leaves behind the port> The continent is  dangerous area, you should proceed there with caution. Do you have any questions?
Player [O]: What can I expect to find on the island? (1) / Tell me about yourself! (2) / Can we sparr? (4) 
    TG (1): The island is a minor port village.  There will be quite  few taverns, so you're spoilt for choice if you want a drink. There are also several trading stations, meaning markets. You should be able to get equipped with some gear to start youe journey. Do you have any othet questions?
Player [O]: Tell me about yourself! (2) / Can we sparr? (3)
    TG (2): I'm from a village in the centre of the continent, (insert village name here). It was a fairly peaceful area, aside from the mayor's children and occasionally the lost drunk. <looks away from the player, out to see, sighing sadly.> I was forced to flee during a rough conflict between us and a neighbouring city. My brother was killed en route. I got a job as a tour guide on the island to make end's meat, but now I enjoy it. <looks back at the player> Do you have any other questions?
Player [O]: Can we sparr? (3) / How long until we reach the island? (4)
    TG (3): Of course! <launch into a sparring match with the player until the player says to stop>
    TG (4):  <with back turned to the island> I'm not sure, we shouldn't be much longer. It doesn't usually take this much ti- <boat crashes onto a mysterious island, sending shrapnel everywhere. Player has temporary blindness, and finds themselves and the tour guide on the beach with a small part of the boat. Player is affected by instant damage of three-five hearts.>

Player: What was that?
TG: <groans> I.. I don't know. <after a moment, stands up and looks around> We appear to be on an island near to the continent. <pauses, looking across near a cave> Shit... a (monster name here). <turns to player> You need to kill these. Can you do it?
Player: With what?
TG: <looking around, points to some of the boat wreckage> There's a stick there. It's better than nothing. Quick! <desperately>
Player: <after getting stick, launch into quest to kill the monsters with TG> 
TG: S-Squire, here! <laying on floor bleeding, a moster on their throat.> 
TG: <after player kills monster> There is a boat on the other side of the island. Take it to the port city. And this. <giving player a note> Good luck, Squire. <dies>
<launch into quest to find the boat, and then short cutscene once they are on the baot. Cutscene ends when they reach the port city and get off of the boat.>
