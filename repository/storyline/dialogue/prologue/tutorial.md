[O] -> Optional responses.

Tour Guide [TG]: <after player interacts with them> Hello, squire! I have been expecting you. Are you here on a mission for the General?
Player [O]: Yes, that's right. (1) / No, goodbye! (2)
    TG: (2) Have a great day!
TG: (1) Alright. Follow me. <walking player on to the boat, stopping in the centre. The boat gains speed as it leaves behind the port> The continent is  dangerous area, you should proceed there with caution. Do you have any questions?
Player [O]: What can I expect to find on the island? (1) / Tell me about yourself! (2) / Can we sparr? (4) 
    TG (1): The island is a minor port village.  There will be quite  few taverns, so you're spoilt for choice if you want a drink. There are also several trading stations, meaning markets. You should be able to get equipped with some gear to start youe journey. Do you have any othet questions?
Player [O]: Tell me about yourself! (2) / Can we sparr? (3)
    TG (2): I'm from a village in the centre of the continent, (insert village name here). It was a fairly peaceful area, aside from the mayor's children and occasionally the lost drunk. <looks away from the player, out to see, sighing sadly.> I was forced to flee during a rough conflict between us and a neighbouring city. My brother was killed en route. I got a job as a tour guide on the island to make end's meat, but now I enjoy it. <looks back at the player> Do you have any other questions?
Player [O]: Can we sparr? (3) / How long until we reach the island? (4)
    TG (3): Of course! <launch into a sparring match with the player until the player says to stop>
    TG (4):  <with back turned to the island> I'm not sure, we shouldn't be much longer. It doesn't usually take this much ti- <boat crashes onto a mysterious island, sending shrapnel everywhere. Player has temporary blindness, and finds themselves and the tour guide on the beach with a small part of the boat. Player is affected by instant damage of three-five hearts.>

Player: What was that?
TG: <groans> I.. I don't know. <after a moment, stands up and looks around> We appear to be on an island near to the continent. <pauses, looking across near a cave> Shit... a (monster name here). <turns to player> You need to kill these. Can you do it?
Player: With what?
TG: <looking around, points to some of the boat wreckage> There's a stick there. It's better than nothing. Quick! <desperately>
Player: <after getting stick, launch into quest to kill the monsters with TG> 
{Once quest has been completed}
TG: <bleeding slightly, looking at the monster corpses> Good job, squire. I'm sorry that I couldn't be of more help.
Player [O]: It's okay! (1) / You could've done a little more.. (2)
TG: Right. In any case, we should-
Assassin: <appearing behind the tour guide, a blade at their throat> "We" won't be doing anything. <begins to draw blade across the tour guide's throat>
TG: Squire, run! <dies and is decapitated>
Assassin: <dropping the tour guide's corpse, walking towards the player> What do we have here? <laughs> An outsider? Well- <turns around as they hear footsteps, seeing the jester running at them>
Jester: <trips over some ship rubble as they run towards the player, carrying a knife> You forgot- <stabs the assassin>
Assassin: <hisses and then dies from the stab wound>
Player: <looking at assassin to the jester> You.. You snuck on to the ship?
Jester: Aye, but I saved you.
Player: That was a fluke-
Jester: No, skill. You have to let me stay. I saved you.
Player [O]: Fine, you can stay. (1) / No, go back to the general! (2)
Jester: There are items scattered around the island we could use to make a raft or a boat. Let's not get shipwrecked! <laughs>
<begin quest to find the pieces of the boat>
