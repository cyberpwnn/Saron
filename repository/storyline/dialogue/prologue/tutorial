[O] -> Optional responses.

Tour Guide [TG]: <after player interacts with them> Hello, squire! I have been expecting you. Are you here on a mission for the General?
Player [O]: Yes, that's right. (1) / No, goodbye! (2)
    TG: (2) Have a great day!
TG: (1) Alright. Follow me. <walking player on to the boat, stopping in the centre. The boat gains speed as it leaves behind the port> The continent is  dangerous area, you should proceed there with caution. Do you have any questions?
Player [O]: What can I expect to find on the island? (1) / Tell me about yourself! (2) / Can we sparr? (4) 
    TG (1): The island is a minor port village.  There will be quite  few taverns, so you're spoilt for choice if you want a drink. There are also several trading stations, meaning markets. You should be able to get equipped with some gear to start youe journey. Do you have any othet questions?
Player [O]: Tell me about yourself! (2) / Can we sparr? (3)
    TG (2): I'm from a village in the centre of the continent, (insert village name here). It was a fairly peaceful area, aside from the mayor's children and occasionally the lost drunk. <looks away from the player, out to see, sighing sadly.> I was forced to flee during a rough conflict between us and a neighbouring city. My brother was killed en route. I got a job as a tour guide on the island to make end's meat, but now I enjoy it. <looks back at the player> Do you have any other questions?
Player [O]: Can we sparr? (3) / How long until we reach the island? (4)
    TG (3): Of course! <launch into a sparring match with the player until the player says to stop>
    TG (4):  <with back turned to the island> I'm not sure, we shouldn't be much longer. It doesn't usually take this much ti- <boat crashes onto a mysterious island, sending shrapnel everywhere. Player has temporary blindness, and finds themselves and the tour guide on the beach with a small part of the boat.>
