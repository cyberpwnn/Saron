#Optional cutscene 1. Antagonist path.
Fade into player in a dungeon.

```
{Fade into the player in the corner of a small cell that appears to be underground. Player is attached by chanes to the wall. Player is sat down.}
Guard: <entering the room, staying by the door as it closes> So, you came here to kill the mayor? Is that it? <angrily. Is carrying a "baton">
Player [O]: I ain't saying anything. (1) / L-look, I can explain... (2)
  Guard (2): Save your breath, squire. I don't want to hear it. You're here on treason. Your punishment will be decided upon at a later date. <leaves>
Guard: <hitting the player with the sword, laughing> So you're a stubborn one then. Good. They're easier to break. I shall enjoy seeing you destroyed. <leaves>
```
##Pt. 2
```
???: Oi, over here.
Player: <turning around> Huh? {enter GM1, 2 and 4, after breaking in. GM1 is dressed in the prison guard's outfit.}
GM2: <carrying a sword> You did good kid. I still don't like you but you did good. <slashing sword behind player, breaking chains>
Player [O]: Thanks, I think.. (1) / I'm a wanted damn criminal now, thanks for that. (2) / Where's the other guy? (3)
  GM4 (2): Don't make us regret this. <growling>
  GM1 (2): You won't be wanted for long. Trust me.
    GM4 (3): He was shot down en route. 
    GM2 (3): Died in the bloody hands of the captain. 
    GM1 (3): We took care of him though. He can burn in hell.
GM1 (1): Enough chat. Let's get the hell out of here. {Fade out. Fade in, in a "flashback", some of what had happened between the attack and the imprisonment.}
