#Port City (#1)
The first city after the player arrives from the tutorial island (cutscene 2).

```
Port Keeper [PK]: Aye! Welcome to (city name here), squire! How was your trip here?
Player [O]: It was great! (1) / It was pretty bad.. (2)
  PK: (1) I'm glad to hear that! / (2) I'm sorry to hear that, but at least you're here now! Better late than never, aye?
PK: I believe you're on a trip here on account of our recent <pausing>... issues? Yes, that's right. Follow me. <walking along the dock towards a building that looks a little like a tavern> Do you have any questions about the island?
Player: What's the history of the island? (1) / Where am I? (2) / Nope! (3)
  PK (1): We used to be known for our weaponary forgers and good merchants. We were the main trade point of the Northern side of the continent, until they arrived. Our death rate skyrocketted since, and trade routes were cut off by severe snow, unpredictable weather and concerns from other cities. 
  PK (2): You're on the Northern port of the continent. 
  Pk (3): Alright, squire. Come now, the mayor and his family are waiting to meet you in the building on the left. You can't miss it, it's the only three-story building on this block. Have fun!
<launch into quest to find and interact with the mayor.>

Mayor: <after player interacts with them> Greetings, squire! We have been awaiting your presence. Take q seat, you are a little late. Do you know why I have summoned you?
Player [O]: No, what is happening? (1) / I do! (2)
    Mayor: (1) Myself and the Crown Council of your continent have called you here on account of the recent threats facing our continent, and ever-advancing. If unchecked, it could take over the realms.
    Mayor: (2) Good, let's cut to the chase, then.
Mayor: It is to my understanding that you are one of the most capable members of your court. Due to this, I want you to be the person to scout my city. On the border to the nearby village there is a cave my men refuse to explore. Explore it and report back to me and I will reward you generously. {Quest}
Player [O]: I will! (1) / Hell no! (2)
    Mayor (1): Take this map. You nay need it.
    Mayor (2): Come back when you're ready to accept.
