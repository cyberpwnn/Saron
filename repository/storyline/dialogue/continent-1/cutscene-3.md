Takes place as soon as the first main quest has been completed.
* GM(number): Group member (number).
```
{The player has just killed all the monsters from the cave. They see a group of about four people coming towards them. GM1 carrying a sword, GM2 and 3 a "baton", GM4 an axe. Faces all covered except for eyes.}
GM1: <arms crossed, walking towards the player slowly, looking at the other three in the wroup> Well, well. What's this? A newbie? My, it's been a while. <laughing> Remember the last one, Two?
GM2: Whacked to death before he could even step in our cave! <other GMs laughing>
GM3: We pounded all of 'em in to the ground!
GM4: Into the damn ground. <slowly>
Player [O]: Look, I don't want any trouble.. (1) / What do you want? (2)
  GM1 (2): <stopping right in front of the player as two more figures block the exit> I suggest you drop that tone. Who're the ones carrying the weapons? <pausing> Not you, that's who. Look over there. <pointing to a corpse> Want that to be you? 
Player [O] Look, I don't want any trouble. / I'm sorry! I was just leaving.
GM3 (1 or either option in 2): Shouldn't have set foot down here then. You ain't going anywhere. <swinging baton, not hitting player>
GM1: Too late now.
GM2: Everyone in town knows this here ain't worth messing with.
Player [O]: <walks towards the door> Let me go. Now. (1) / What do you want from me? (2)
  GM4: <swinging axe, hitting the player once> You're not going anywhere, mate. 
GM2: Not until you do a little something for us, anyway.
GM1: Consider it... <pausing> Payment. For tresspassing.
  GM3 (1): We want you to do a little something for us.
GM1: As payment. For.. tresspassing.
GM4: We can let you leave, but on this condition: you kill the mayor.
GM2: Don't even try to escape. We have.. ways. If you even consider turning us over, we will find you. We will hunt you.
GM3: We will track you to the ends of the realms.
GM1: And we will kill you. Clear?
Player [O]: Over my dead body will I help the likes of you. (1) / Fine. I'll do it. But what's in it for me?
  GM2 (2): That can be arranged. {Launch into battle against the group}
GM2: Your life. 
GM4: Take this. We will know if you complete this task. You're free of it, if you are successful.
Player: And if I'm not?
GM4: Then either way, you are dead.
```
#If player is knocked unconscious by the group, the following will be added to the cutscene.
```
<Fade cutscene out ending on the player's unconscious body and the group carrying it away. Fade in on the player awakening in a hospital with a note from the group expressing that they will be following the player's every move from then on.>
