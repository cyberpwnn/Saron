```
{The player has just killed all the monsters from the cave. They see a group of about four people coming towards them. GM1 carrying a sword, GM2 and 3 a "baton", GM4 an axe. Faces all covered except for eyes.}
GM1: <arms crossed, walking towards the player slowly, looking at the other three in the wroup> Well, well. What's this? A newbie? My, it's been a while. <laughing> Remember the last one, Two?
GM2: Whacked to death before he could even step in our cave! <other GMs laughing>
GM3: We pounded all of 'em into the ground!
GM4: Into the damn ground. <slowly>
Player [O]: Look, I don't want any trouble.. (1) / What do you want? (2)
  GM1 (2): <stopping right in front of the player as two more figures block the exit> I suggest you drop that tone. Who're the ones carrying the weapons? <pausing> Not you, that's who. Look over there. <pointing to a corpse> Want that to be you? 
Player [O] Look, I don't want any trouble. / I'm sorry! I was just leaving.
GM3 (1 or either option in 2): Shouldn't have set foot down here then. You ain't going anywhere. <swinging baton, not hitting player>
GM1: Too late now.
GM2: Everyone in town knows this here ain't worth messing with.
